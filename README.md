# collision-gravity-simulator
A rudimentary physics simulator including object gravity and collisions (C#/WPF)

Description
-----------
Using the mouse and the provided controls, this application allows for the creation of mobile and fixed objects. Mobile objects have vectors for position and velocity, as well as a property for size, from which we derive mass. These influence their reactions to collisions with other objects. Fixed objects have vectors for position, a similar properties for size and mass, and local gravity with area-of-effect and strength based on size and mass. 


Background
----------
This application was developed as a project for an intermediate OOP class. 


Controls
--------

  The top bar includes the settings for the creation of objects. From left to right, they include a checkbox for the type of object         (fixed/mobile) and sliders for size, angle, and velocity. The sliders for angle and velocity will maintain a value but have no effect on   fixed objects. 
  
  The left sidebar is a stop/start button, which will provide control over the motion of the balls (effectively pause/play on the world)
  
  The right sidebar is a clear button, which will remove all mobile objects if your screen is too cluttered or you wish to start from       scratch. 
  
  Left clicking will place objects on the screen using the settings entered in the top
  
  Right clicking on any object will remove it.
